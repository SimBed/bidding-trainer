## Intention
A quick and dirty tool to practise bidding for the card game bridge.<br>
Choose the convention you want to practise and it will simulate an appropriate hand for you to consider.<br>
I've added a number of conventions, others are easily added to the Deal class.<br>
I've used Rails, whcih is overkill. It's little more than a few Ruby classes, no database.<br>
